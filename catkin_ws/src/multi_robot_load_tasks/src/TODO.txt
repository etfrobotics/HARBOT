ROS2-ROS1 Bridge bringup: **
    - Refactor and add Gurobi API in ROS2
    - Automate ROS2 bringup script  

Debug the robot navigation on a new map. ***
    - Make a smaller map with pillars instead of walls which are not completely connected.
    - Investigate the localization move_base crashes

Real-robot refactor: *
    - Add a flag that switches the nodes and interfaces for a real robot - > with the command_manager system. 
    - The controllers will differ but the general scheduler should stay the same

Change the route_parser to be more general

Make a better environment(Al Silal.. etc)
