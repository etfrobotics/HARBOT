- Discussions about previously done work that included:
	- The RAAD paper
	- Developed robot demo for the RBKAIROS robot

- TODO:
	- Fix the timing issue in the simulation and merge control for real and simulated systems.
	- Refactor documentation, perform ROS2 integration testing, and automate ROS2/1 Bridge bring up with a script.
	- Explore the possibility of an IROS submission.

- Possible IROS submission, where the work from the RAAD paper would be expanded upon. Additions would consist of including a parser for Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) to encapsulate different capabilities for the planning algorithm pipeline.

- Discussions about the Control dashboard for the Unitree GO1 legged robot. Implementation details. GitHub refactoring. Digital twin discussion.
