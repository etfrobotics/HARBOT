Prof. Kosta Jovanovic ( kostaj@etf.rs ) Co-I: Dr. Nikola Knezevic ( knezevic@etf.rs ) Project Overview The successful integration of autonomous systems in real-world environments, such as last-mile logistics and agriculture, requires effectively handling uncertainties and risks. This research proposal emphasizes the development of a novel technique for integrated autonomy, with a focus on hierarchical reasoning, uncertainty-aware planning, and compliant manipulation and material handling in autonomous legged robots integrated with autonomous vehicle platforms. Wheeled robots, although advantageous in many applications, have some inherent disadvantages when it comes to operating in challenging terrains or delicate environments. Some of these drawbacks include limited mobility over rough terrain, struggling to traverse uneven surfaces, such as rubble, steep or loose ground. Moreover, they trample continuous strips of land, thereby reducing the viable crop area in agricultural applications. Legged robots can overcome these limitations, making them suitable for the targeted applications in this proposal. A key aspect of the proposed approach is leveraging prediction and perception subsystems that not only provide scene understanding but also incorporate a degree of doubt or suspicion in their outputs. Unlike traditional systems that assume output accuracy, the project requires these subsystems to explicitly represent uncertainty, enabling the reasoning module to make well-informed decisions. Additionally, the integration of the legged robot with an autonomous vehicle will offer benefits such as charging capabilities, acting as a depot for logistics, and providing storage for plants or crop samples in agriculture.
