Prof. Kosta Jovanovic ( kostaj@etf.rs ) Co-I: Dr. Nikola Knezevic ( knezevic@etf.rs ) Project Overview The successful integration of autonomous systems in real-world environments, such as last-mile logistics and agriculture, requires effectively handling uncertainties and risks. This research proposal emphasizes the development of a novel technique for integrated autonomy, with a focus on hierarchical reasoning, uncertainty-aware planning, and compliant manipulation and material handling in autonomous legged robots integrated with autonomous vehicle platforms. Wheeled robots, although advantageous in many applications, have some inherent disadvantages when it comes to operating in challenging terrains or delicate environments. Some of these drawbacks include limited mobility over rough terrain, struggling to traverse uneven surfaces, such as rubble, steep or loose ground. Moreover, they trample continuous strips of land, thereby reducing the viable crop area in agricultural applications. Legged robots can overcome these limitations, making them suitable for the targeted applications in this proposal. A key aspect of the proposed approach is leveraging prediction and perception subsystems that not only provide scene understanding but also incorporate a degree of doubt or suspicion in their outputs. Unlike traditional systems that assume output accuracy, the project requires these subsystems to explicitly represent uncertainty, enabling the reasoning module to make well-informed decisions. Additionally, the integration of the legged robot with an autonomous vehicle will offer benefits such as charging capabilities, acting as a depot for logistics, and providing storage for plants or crop samples in agriculture.

(Sumbal, Veljko, R. Nikola) RDDL integration meeting We have discussed about the minimum possible example of the RDDL multi-bin last mile logistics harvesting problem. Topics of the Discussion RDDL \u2013 Exploring how RDDL functions through a concrete example: Current RDDL implementation includes a series of fruit locations, with one robot. The robot visits each of the locations and has a 95% chance of successful picking operation. It retries the operation until it succeeds, and then it deposites the fruit to the other depo or agents. Indentified an critical implementational issue, how can the agent synchronize with the real-world sensor data and know when it didn't succeed in the grasping operations? As of now it is open ended, where the engine outputs actions each timestep as a json file, but if the robot doesn't signal a failed grasp to the planner, the world model of the planner diverges from the real-world. The agent could think that the state of the world is different than it is, and this needs to be changed each timestep (rerun of the plan) Feedback Loop Analysis: Attempting to determine what a feedback loop of any kind would look like within the RDDL framework. Implementation Perspective: Discussing how such a system could be implemented in practice \u2014 including suitable data types, such as matrices, lists, or other structures. https://arxiv.org/html/2211.05939v5 - pyRDDLGym, practical way to integrate a feedback loop. Beacuse this is a gym environment the following plans can be tested and used in a publications that are ready to use with out-of-the-box planners: 1. JaxPlan: Planning through autodifferentiation GurobiPlan: Planning through mixed discrete-continuous optimization PROST: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN, PPO, etc.): Popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms from Stable Baselines and RLlib Symbolic Dynamic Programming: Exact Symbolic regression-based planning and policy evaluation Two possible publications were dicsussed: Motivating example1: Picking fruits in a field, if there is wind in some part of the field, it increases uncertainty of the grasping operation, so that the planner should take that into account with the newly coputed lower probabilites of grasping. Motivating example2: If there are lots of branches, there is a higher probability of robot collision so the robot should be more compliant, and the planner should take that into account in the harvesting regions where the clutter is more prominent. Initial publication, where the main contribution would be the added feedback loop for the changing probabilities, a simple case with one of the robots, and the evaluation experiment. The feedback loop would be ran once. Subsequent publications would include a time-horizon approach in computing the probabilities for robot-task-level actions. At each period ex. T=15mins The algorithm would replan the actions using new probabilities dervied from sensor data (Mimicing the MPC approach). IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION DETAL: RDDL engines output actions each timestep. Import implementation detail would include either a failed_action state or init file cganges which leads to a probability reruns. RDDL backend needs to be investigated, along with the pyRDDLGym. Investigation outcome: Documentation link: https://pyrddlgym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html Closed loop replanning: https://pyrddlgym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/closed_loop_replanning_with_jaxplan.html This can be used along with a simple 2D environment, along with a modeled mobile robot with omnidirectional drive.

Agreed on switching the planning methodology from P-PDDL to Relational Dynamic Influence Diagram Language (RDDL) Agreed on the integration for a high-level scenario: mobile manipulators equipped with onboard collection devices will go to the farm, grasp the fruits and, upon reaching full capacity, proceed to the unloading station. They will unload and go for another trip if needed. Discussed the Gazebo integration of the multi-agent smart greenhouse simulation Discussed the integration of a smart compliant wrist and gripper design for agriculture Discussed tbe application of the smart gripper design in the multi-robot case Additional Notes RDDL Planner - an example - PROST Online Probabilistic planner that repeatedly computes which action to take in the current state, executes that action by interacting with rddlsim, observes the resulting outcome, and updates the current state according to the outcome. The language is state and action - fluent, meaning it better fits into our paradigm of addaptable, action feedback based, reactive planner. States, can be modeled by a fluent variable Actions, can be modeled by a fluent variable Fluent here means dynamic, evolves with new sensor data. Each state-fluent variable needs to have a conditional probability function describing the evolution from one to the other state. Mobile stiffness shaping uses a mobile manipulator to optimize and plan the stiffness acording to the user defined trajectory and manipulator interaction requirements. It utilizes all of the degrees of freedom to furfil the task. Meeting 14.08.2025.

They will unload and go for another trip if needed. Probabilistic PDDL will be used to model the task planning part and to generate a policy-based plan. The objective can be to maximize goal reachability and the mission success rate. Additional Notes Determine how to tune the probabilities for the actions. Examine grasping constraints closely and define a well-structured global objective. One possible objective could be to minimize fruit waste in case the robot fails to grasp properly.

Nikola) RDDL integration meeting We have discussed about the minimum possible example of the RDDL multi-bin last mile logistics harvesting problem. Topics of the Discussion RDDL \u2013 Exploring how RDDL functions through a concrete example: Current RDDL implementation includes a series of fruit locations, with one robot. The robot visits each of the locations and has a 95% chance of successful picking operation. It retries the operation until it succeeds, and then it deposites the fruit to the other depo or agents. Indentified an critical implementational issue, how can the agent synchronize with the real-world sensor data and know when it didn't succeed in the grasping operations? As of now it is open ended, where the engine outputs actions each timestep as a json file, but if the robot doesn't signal a failed grasp to the planner, the world model of the planner diverges from the real-world. The agent could think that the state of the world is different than it is, and this needs to be changed each timestep (rerun of the plan) Feedback Loop Analysis: Attempting to determine what a feedback loop of any kind would look like within the RDDL framework. Implementation Perspective: Discussing how such a system could be implemented in practice \u2014 including suitable data types, such as matrices, lists, or other structures. https://arxiv.org/html/2211.05939v5 - pyRDDLGym, practical way to integrate a feedback loop. Beacuse this is a gym environment the following plans can be tested and used in a publications that are ready to use with out-of-the-box planners: 1. JaxPlan: Planning through autodifferentiation GurobiPlan: Planning through mixed discrete-continuous optimization PROST: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN, PPO, etc.): Popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms from Stable Baselines and RLlib Symbolic Dynamic Programming: Exact Symbolic regression-based planning and policy evaluation Two possible publications were dicsussed: Motivating example1: Picking fruits in a field, if there is wind in some part of the field, it increases uncertainty of the grasping operation, so that the planner should take that into account with the newly coputed lower probabilites of grasping. Motivating example2: If there are lots of branches, there is a higher probability of robot collision so the robot should be more compliant, and the planner should take that into account in the harvesting regions where the clutter is more prominent. Initial publication, where the main contribution would be the added feedback loop for the changing probabilities, a simple case with one of the robots, and the evaluation experiment. The feedback loop would be ran once. Subsequent publications would include a time-horizon approach in computing the probabilities for robot-task-level actions. At each period ex. T=15mins The algorithm would replan the actions using new probabilities dervied from sensor data (Mimicing the MPC approach). IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION DETAL: RDDL engines output actions each timestep. Import implementation detail would include either a failed_action state or init file cganges which leads to a probability reruns. RDDL backend needs to be investigated, along with the pyRDDLGym.
